In the last few days, I have been working with Python. I have never worked with it earlier. So, a feature that I need to develop involves cryptography. But, the project I working on today is already an implementation in Java, then my job was to migrate Java to Python. I enjoy the experience of programming in Python, until why I only programming in a compiled language like Kotlin and Java. The style is so strange when you want to discover what methods are available in the programming language, and I think that discovering material how something works is harder than Java.
